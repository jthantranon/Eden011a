/* 
 * someone told me once that it wasn't shocking to hear about
 * voilence and death in eastern countries, mainly because they
 * did not value life as much as westerners did;
 * 
 * just now I was listening to Chimamanda Adichie talking to an
 * audience about telling stories, and that there are single 
 * stories, where people are depicted in a singular way, over
 * and over, until it is a universally accepted standard of
 * authenticity;
 * 
 * another point that was made, and one that became apparent to
 * me likewise, was that power had made a place for hypocrisy 
 * where westerners (or americans) would tell stories from a 
 * position of power combined with unfamiliarity, breeding
 * a story that is more about appeasing to a perpertuation of
 * that power over the illumination of the truth;
 * 
 * i then looked inwardly at how I had fallen pray to this
 * appeasing and developed an opinion towards an eastern
 * civilization that was based on the popularity of a single
 * story that was fed to myself and my peers in the interests
 * of profit with a disregard for the reality of foriegners;
 * 
 * the only resolution now would be to engage properly with
 * a sober view of the world, that was a conclusion of an
 * diverse exposure to the the many things that are outside 
 * of my own experiences;
 * 
 * the tragedy of the single story is that it robs people
 * of dignity, emphasising how we are different as opposed
 * to how we are the same.

 * you have invested can be either for good or for evil.
